  Md Mobin | Portfolio  | Smk Winner | SmkWinner
  
  I am pursuing graduation in B.Tech(computer science and engineering) from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University.
  I am a self-taught developer and I have been learning new technologies and frameworks on my own.
  I have a good knowledge of Flutter, Dart, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase.
  I have worked on many projects and I have also worked on some freelance projects.
  I am a quick learner and I am always ready to learn new things.
  I am a team player and I am always ready to work in a team.
  Practice makes you perfect
